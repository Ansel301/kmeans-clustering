This is a group project. I am responsible for both logistic regression and nearest centroid classifier.

These programs use gene expression cancer RNA-Seq dataset. Since the test dataset contains new cancer types that aren't in training dataset. We use both logistic regression and nearest centroid for classification. The data that can't be classified to one class accurately enough will be flagged as unknown type. We then use K-means clustering to generate new cluster to deal with new types of data.

The accuracy using logistic regression classifier is about 98%\n
The accuracy using nearest centroid classifier is about 85%
